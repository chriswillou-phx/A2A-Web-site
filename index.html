      Helping organizations move from marketing activity to marketing accountability.

      Fractional CMO & strategic marketing leadership for organizations that need
      clarity, focus, and measurable impact.

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Most marketing teams are busy — but not accountable. Activity is high.
      Budgets are spent. Campaigns launch. Yet leadership still struggles to
      understand what’s working, why it’s working, and how marketing contributes
      to business results.
    </p>
    <p>
      What’s missing isn’t effort. It’s clarity, structure, and leadership.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Help</h2>
    <p>
      I work with organizations that need marketing leadership — not just
      marketing execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a fractional CMO and senior marketing advisor, I help companies bring
      discipline and accountability to their marketing function by defining a
      clear marketing vision aligned to business goals, designing and scaling the
      right team structure, clarifying brand positioning and customer experience,
      and building data-driven measurement and KPI frameworks.
    </p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      My passion for marketing began long before my career did. Having grown up
      across multiple countries, I developed an early fascination with human
      behavior — what drives decisions, builds trust, and creates connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over my 30-year career, I’ve worked in leading agencies and built
      high-performing in-house teams across travel, hospitality, real estate,
      loyalty, retail, and CPG. I help organizations transform marketing from a
      tactical function into an accountable driver of growth.
