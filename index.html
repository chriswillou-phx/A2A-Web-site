      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Most marketing teams are busy — but not accountable. Activity is high. Budgets are spent.
          Campaigns launch. Yet leadership still struggles to understand what’s working, why it’s
          working, and how marketing contributes to business results.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s missing isn’t effort. It’s clarity, structure, and leadership.

      <h2>How I Help</h2>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          I work with organizations that need marketing leadership — not just marketing execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a fractional CMO and senior marketing advisor, I help companies bring discipline and
          accountability to their marketing function by defining a clear marketing vision aligned to
          business goals, designing and scaling the right team structure, clarifying brand positioning
          and customer experience, and building data-driven measurement and KPI frameworks.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          My passion for marketing began long before my career did. Having grown up across multiple
          countries, I developed an early fascination with human behavior — what drives decisions,
          builds trust, and creates connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over my 30-year career, I’ve worked in leading agencies and built high-performing in-house
          teams across travel, hospitality, real estate, loyalty, retail, and CPG. I help organizations
          transform marketing from a tactical function into an accountable driver of growth.
