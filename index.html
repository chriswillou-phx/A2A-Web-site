<h1>A2A Advisory</h1>
<div class="tagline">
Helping organizations move from marketing activity to marketing accountability.
</div>

<p>
Fractional CMO & strategic marketing leadership for organizations that need clarity,
focus, and measurable impact.
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
Most marketing teams are busy — but not accountable. Activity is high. Budgets are spent.
Campaigns launch. Yet leadership still struggles to understand what’s working, why it’s
working, and how marketing contributes to business results.
</p>

<h2>How I Help</h2>
<p>
I work with organizations that need marketing leadership — not just marketing execution.
As a fractional CMO and senior marketing advisor, I help companies bring discipline and
accountability to their marketing function.
