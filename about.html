            <p>
              My passion for marketing began long before my career did. Growing up
              across Mexico, Norway, Japan, and the U.S., I became fascinated by how
              people’s customs, languages, and habits shape the way they see and
              interact with the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, marketing is more complex than ever — and more measurable than
              ever. Yet most organizations still struggle to translate activity into
              impact.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over my 30-year career, I’ve worked in leading agencies and built
              high-performing in-house teams across travel, hospitality, real estate,
              loyalty, retail, and CPG. I help organizations transform marketing from a
              tactical function into an accountable driver of growth.
