          My passion for marketing began long before my career did. Growing up
          across Mexico, Norway, Japan, and the U.S., I became fascinated by how
          people’s customs, languages, and habits shape the way they see and
          interact with the world.

          Today, marketing is more complex than ever — and more measurable than
          ever. Yet most organizations still struggle to translate activity into
          impact.

          Over my 30-year career, I’ve worked in leading agencies and built
          high-performing in-house teams across travel, hospitality, real estate,
          loyalty, retail, and CPG. I help organizations transform marketing from
          a tactical function into an accountable driver of growth.
